# Spike Response Plasticity

Implementation of a linear-nonlinear model of short-term plasticity as described in
[Linear-Nonlinear Cascades Capture Synaptic Dynamics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/01/27/2020.06.04.133892).

## Repository Structure

- The **srplasticity** package contains all source code and implements
the SRP model and the associated parameter inference.
- The **examples** directory contains use examples and tutorials (currently in progress)
- The **scripts** directory contains the scripts to reproduce the figures in the manuscript
- The **data** directory contains the data used in the manuscript figures and the use examples.
